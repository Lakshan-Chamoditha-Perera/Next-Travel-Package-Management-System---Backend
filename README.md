## Architecture and Design Patterns

### Microservices Architecture

The system follows a microservices architecture to provide scalability, flexibility, and modularity. Each service (Travel Packages, Vehicles, Hotels, etc.) operates independently and communicates via APIs. This architecture allows for easier development, deployment, and maintenance of individual services.

### Service Discovery with Eureka

Eureka, a service registry and discovery tool from Spring Cloud, is utilized for service registration and discovery within the microservices architecture. It allows services to find and communicate with each other dynamically.


### Design Patterns

#### Repository Pattern

The system uses the Repository pattern to manage data access logic in a separate layer, providing a clean separation between the data access code and business logic.

#### Builder Pattern

For creating complex objects like package details, the Builder pattern is implemented to simplify the creation process, enhance readability, and provide flexibility in object creation.

### n-tier Architecture: DAO and Service Layers

The Next Travel Pvt Ltd system follows an n-tier architecture, organizing its components into distinct layers for efficient management and separation of concerns. Two key layers include the Data Access Object (DAO) layer and the Service layer.

#### DAO (Data Access Object) Layer

The DAO layer serves as an interface between the application logic and the database, encapsulating all interactions with the underlying data storage. Key aspects of the DAO layer include:

- **Data Access:** DAO classes are responsible for accessing and manipulating data in the database. They encapsulate CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations specific to each entity.
- **Entity Mapping:** Mapping of database entities to corresponding Java objects/entities is handled within the DAO layer, maintaining a clear separation of concerns.
- **Data Persistence:** DAOs manage the persistence of data, ensuring data integrity and handling transactions where necessary.

#### Service Layer

The Service layer acts as an intermediary between the DAO layer and the presentation layer (controllers or endpoints). It encapsulates business logic, coordinating various operations and interactions within the application. Key aspects of the Service layer include:

- **Business Logic:** Service classes contain the application's business logic, orchestrating the processing of data and implementing business rules.
- **Transaction Management:** Services manage transactions across multiple DAO operations, ensuring consistency and atomicity of operations.
- **Encapsulation of Operations:** Services expose methods that perform specific operations or workflows, providing a higher level of abstraction to the presentation layer.

The n-tier architecture with distinct DAO and Service layers ensures a clear separation of concerns, promotes modularity, and facilitates easier maintenance and scalability of the Next Travel Pvt Ltd system.


### Design Patterns in DAO and Service Layers

#### Facade Pattern in DAO Layer

The DAO layer in the Next Travel Pvt Ltd system implements the Facade design pattern. This pattern serves as a simplified interface to a more complex set of components within the data access layer, providing a unified interface to the outside world. Key aspects of the Facade pattern include:

- **Simplified Interface:** The Facade class provides a simplified and unified interface, hiding the complexities of multiple DAOs and their interactions.
- **Encapsulation of Logic:** It encapsulates complex data access logic and interactions with multiple entities or data sources, providing a higher-level abstraction.

#### Factory Design Pattern in DAO and Service Layers

The DAO and Service layers leverage the Factory design pattern to create instances of objects or components based on specific conditions or requirements.

##### DAO Layer's Factory Pattern

- **DAO Factory:** The DAO Factory pattern encapsulates the creation of DAO instances for different entities, abstracting the instantiation process and providing a centralized point for creating DAO instances.
- **Dynamic DAO Creation:** It allows the system to dynamically create appropriate DAO instances based on the type of entity or data source, enhancing flexibility and maintainability.

##### Service Layer's Factory Pattern

- **Service Factory:** Similarly, the Service Factory pattern encapsulates the creation of service instances, allowing the system to create service instances based on specific conditions or configurations.
- **Abstracting Service Creation:** It abstracts the creation logic, enabling the system to instantiate services based on specific criteria or dynamic requirements.

The use of the Facade pattern in the DAO layer and the Factory design pattern in both the DAO and Service layers contributes to the system's modularity, flexibility, and maintainability by encapsulating complexities and abstracting object creation processes.

The Next Travel Pvt Ltd system employs an API Gateway service as a central point of entry for managing and routing incoming requests across various microservices. The API Gateway, a key component in the system's architecture, serves multiple purposes:

- **Request Routing:** All external client requests, whether for travel packages, vehicle details, hotels, or user services, are routed through the API Gateway.
- **Aggregation:** It aggregates and orchestrates data from multiple microservices, presenting a unified API to the clients, simplifying client interactions.
- **Security:** It handles authentication and authorization, enforcing security protocols and access control policies before requests reach the microservices.
- **Load Balancing:** Distributes incoming requests across multiple instances of microservices, ensuring optimal performance and scalability.

The API Gateway service serves as a crucial layer ensuring efficient communication between clients and the underlying microservices, enhancing security, performance, and maintainability of the entire system.
